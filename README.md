This is currently a playpen to help me think about the [Fedora API Specification](https://github.com/fcrepo/fcrepo-specification) (and see [current editors' draft](https://fcrepo.github.io/fcrepo-specification/)). If it ever ends up being anything else then I'll probably update this readme.

For now, if you are really keen, check out [the not-so-secret README](README_secret.md).
